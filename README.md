# <u>**Pytorch_Implementations**
This document contains my solutions to the programming exercises from https://www.learnpytorch.io/

The work focuses on implementing and experimenting with core machine learning and deep learning paradigms using PyTorch- an optimized tensor computation library that provides dynamic computation graphs and GPU acceleration.

These exercises were done as during my tenure as a coodinator under the AI CLUB of IIT Madras.
